# Olympics
In this repository, I will be answering various questions related to the dataset using SQL (PostgreSQL). Dataset is available on Kaggle 
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results), questions are taken from techTFQ 
(https://techtfq.com/blog/practice-writing-sql-queries-using-real-dataset#google_vignette=).
